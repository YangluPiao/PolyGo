# PolyGo
###Usage:<br>
1. `git clone` or download the zip file.<br>
2. Build the compiler by
```
make
```<br>
3. Run demo by 
```
sh polygo ./demo/name-of-demo-file.pg
```
<br>
 or directly run test suite directly by 
 ```
 sh testall.sh
 ```
 4. If something goes wrong while running a `name-of-test-file.pg` file, a `name-of-test-file.log` file will be generated and you can check it out.
